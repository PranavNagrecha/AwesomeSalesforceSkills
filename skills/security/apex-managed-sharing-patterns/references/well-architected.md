# Well-Architected Notes — Apex Managed Sharing Patterns

**Security:** Custom RowCause preserves the audit trail of why access was granted and prevents platform recalc from wiping it.

**Reliability:** Paired grant/revoke logic and RowCause-scoped deletes keep sharing consistent with the driving data even under bulk loads.

**Operational Excellence:** Service classes centralize the policy so admins do not touch __Share directly.
