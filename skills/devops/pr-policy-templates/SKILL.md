# Pull Request Policy Templates

A consistent PR template + CODEOWNERS + required checks shifts quality left. This skill defines a template with sections for scope, test evidence, deploy plan, and risk; a CODEOWNERS matching metadata types to owning teams; and branch-protection rules requiring status checks (validation deploy, test run, scan).

## Adoption Signals

Teams >3 people; regulated or production-critical repos.

- Required when audit evidence (who reviewed, when, against what checklist) must be derivable from PR history.
- Required when a CODEOWNERS rule must enforce architect sign-off for irreversible metadata changes.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Write `.github/pull_request_template.md` with Scope, Test Evidence, Deploy Plan, Rollback, and Risk sections.
2. Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` mapping `force-app/main/default/flows/` to @flow-team, `classes/` to @apex-team, etc.
3. Enable branch protection: require PR + 1 review + all required checks green + CODEOWNERS approval.
4. Wire required status checks: validation deploy, Apex test run ≥75%, PMD/Checkmarx scan.
5. Quarterly: audit merged PRs; measure cycle time and revert rate; tune policy.

## Key Considerations

- CODEOWNERS with @team handles scales better than individual usernames.
- Coverage can be blocker or soft warning — pick one and enforce consistently.
- Squash-merge keeps history clean; but preserve deploy traceability with merge commits.
- Template must be ≤1 screen — long templates get ignored.

## Worked Examples (see `references/examples.md`)

- *CODEOWNERS mapping* — Flow changes route to flow team
- *Required check: validation deploy* — Prevent 'works in dev' surprises

## Common Gotchas (see `references/gotchas.md`)

- **CODEOWNERS without team** — User leaves; PRs stuck.
- **Template too long** — Authors delete it.
- **Coverage check both warn+block inconsistent** — Confusion.

## Top LLM Anti-Patterns (full list in `references/llm-anti-patterns.md`)

- Optional PR template (unused)
- CODEOWNERS with personal accounts
- No validation deploy gate
