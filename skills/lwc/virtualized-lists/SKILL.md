# LWC Virtualized Lists

Rendering 10,000 DOM nodes crashes mobile and lags desktop. Virtualization renders only ~2 screens worth of rows and swaps them as the viewport scrolls. `lightning-datatable` has built-in infinite scroll; for custom layouts use an IntersectionObserver-based pattern with fixed row height. This skill covers both paths plus the accessibility requirements (aria-rowcount, keyboard reachability) that are easy to miss when optimizing for performance.

## Adoption Signals

Lists beyond 500 rows or tables beyond 1000. Not for simple short lists.

- Required when initial render time exceeds 500ms or the user reports janky scroll on lower-end devices.
- Required for tables with computed columns (formulas, joins) where each row's render cost compounds.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Measure: if first render <100ms, skip virtualization.
2. `lightning-datatable enable-infinite-loading` + `onloadmore` handler that paginates server-side.
3. Custom: fixed row height + IntersectionObserver sentinels + windowed render of visible + buffer rows.
4. Cache row data client-side; server returns pages of 50–200.
5. Test with 10,000-row fixture to measure FPS and memory.

## Key Considerations

- Variable row heights break naive virtualization; use a measured-height library or fix the height.
- Screen readers must see a meaningful row count (`aria-rowcount`).
- Keyboard navigation must still reach off-screen rows logically.
- Server pagination > client-side filtering for 10k+ datasets.

## Worked Examples (see `references/examples.md`)

- *10k-row datatable* — Audit log viewer
- *Custom list with IO* — Activity feed

## Common Gotchas (see `references/gotchas.md`)

- **Variable row height** — Items jump around on scroll.
- **aria-rowcount missing** — Screen reader reports 'list with 20 items' on a 10k list.
- **Client-side filter on big list** — Re-filters 10k rows on each keystroke; jank.

## Top LLM Anti-Patterns (full list in `references/llm-anti-patterns.md`)

- Rendering 10k rows directly
- Client-side filter on huge datasets
- Missing aria-rowcount
