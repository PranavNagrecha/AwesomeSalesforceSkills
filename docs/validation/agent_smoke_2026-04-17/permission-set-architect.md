# Agent Smoke Test — `permission-set-architect`

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Agent version:** `1.1.0`
**Class:** `runtime`
**Modes:** ``
**Requires org:** `true`

## TL;DR for humans

Agent `permission-set-architect` passed all structural + dependency checks. Its declared dependencies exist, its slash-command exists, and its frontmatter is schema-valid.

## What the smoke test did

- Parsed `agents/permission-set-architect/AGENT.md`
- Ran 6 structural checks against a live-org context (`sfskills-dev`)
- No tool calls issued against the org beyond what probe validation already covered

## Check results

| Check | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Required sections present + in order | ✅ | (none) |
| Citations resolve to real files | ✅ | (none) |
| Dependencies cover all citations | ✅ | (none) |
| Slash-command coverage | ✅ | covered by /architect-perms |
| Inputs schema valid JSON (if present) | ✅ | (none) |
| Declared probes executable | ✅ | (none) |

## What a human reviewer should check

- [ ] Does the TL;DR match the actual behavior of `permission-set-architect` in production?
- [ ] Are any of the warnings actually critical in your environment?
- [ ] Do the declared dependencies cover everything the agent actually needs?
